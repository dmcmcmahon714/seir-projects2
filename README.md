Problem: I have a simple/minor pain issue that I have a hard time keeping track of over time.
General Purpose/Idea: Allows users to rate their pain based on the date.

MVC format application with mongodb and bcrypt authentication. 

I wouldl like to incorporate some graph or visualization of the data over time, but this serves the main purpose. 

Basic wireframe: 

User Login in ***SESSIONS***

User Page with calendar

pain scale, notes

seeding - add id to each model
